# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?
My initial experience with python was good. I learned many things, its similar to java in many ways but also different. I think it is a lot simpler than java, and that is good because it can make your code shorter, but for me its a bit weird and im not used to it. This is probably because in java, everything is explicit in your code and is obvious to tell what its doing, like in a java for loop
for(int i=0;i<10;i++)  you know what is happening inside the for loop just by looking at the code. But in python when you write
for i in range(10): i had no idea what it meant but it is a lot shorter than java. Python does many things automatically for you unlike java.
2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.
I used chatgpt to help me because I had no python experience so I made it teach me the basics and show me how to do some problems. When there was a problem I didnt know how to do (which was basically all of them since I dont know python) I asked it what the syntax was and I did guessing and checking.
3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?
The concept that was most challenging is just how simple python is compared to java. I didnt know there was different types of for loops like one to look through an array like for i in lst:
I asked AI how it worked and I didnt know that python could just automatically iterate through an array with just that line of code.
4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?
I learned that AI can help me understand a new coding language. I think if AI gives you the answer you should ask it why that and like go through how the code works. I had to ask AI for the answer many times simply because I don't know any python so I didnt know how to write it. But once it gave me the answer if I saw anything I didnt understand I would ask chatgpt why python does this and the syntax for it.
